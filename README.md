## Explanation

Simple CSS off-canvas menu, which opens with an overlay. A hidden checkbox was used to open the Menu. To close the Menu was used a reset button, which unchecks a checkbox.

Overlay prevents scroll on the BODY (and save scroll position), but content of the Menu is scrollable.

Based on an idea by [Luxiyalu](https://github.com/Luxiyalu/scrollable-overlay).
